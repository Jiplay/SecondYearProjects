HOW IT WORKS ?

./plazza <multipliyer of cooking time> <cooks per kitchen> <sleep time to refill kitchen>


What we can do :
-take complex order like : "regina L x2; margarita S x2; fantasia L x1; americana XL x1"
-We can listen to the user to take command
-Cooks 4 differents pizza (Regina / Margarita / Americana / Fantasia)
-Allocate kitchen dynamically with the nb of pizza ordered
-Create processes to prepare several pizza at the same time
-Log when a Pizza is done or a Kitchen is deleted


What we can't do :
-Use the same kitchen more than one time (not very ecologic '-').
-Take more than one order, after the 1st order our prog will crash, and you have to re-lauch    it to make another order.
